# Ciiverse
My attempt at a Miiverse clone created using php. My code is very bad so you may not understand it but here you go anyway.

# Preparations
It's a pretty straight forward process. You will need Apache, PHP, and MySQL. There are a bunch of tutorials online on how to install all of these. But once you install everything, you should be able to set up Ciiverse easily.

Also, if you're using a shared hosting service that supports PHP, it should be even easier if you know what you're doing.

# How to set up
-- Put everything in the "ciiverse-php" folder into your "htdocs" folder or whatever it's called... 
-- Create a new db and export "database.sql" inside it.
-- Go to the "config.php" file inside the "lib" folder and configure everything how you want it.
-- Enjoy Ciiverse.

# How do I create communities?
It's now easier to create communities on the newer versions of Ciiverse. If you haven't already, create an account and give yourself db access using phpmyadmin or some other method. Now, you should have access to the Staff Panel, which allows you to create and edit communities how you see fit, and also allows you to do more.
