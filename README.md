# Ciiverse
My attempt at a Miiverse clone created using php. My code is very bad so you may not understand it but here you go anyway.

# What you will need
* Xampp
* MySQL

# What to do
- Copy the files in the ciiverse-php folder to the directory where you run the webpage.
- Create a new Database called "Ciiverse"
- Import database.sql to that database.
- Enjoy messing around with it or whatever.
